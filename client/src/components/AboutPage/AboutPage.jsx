						<p>
							This is a web app to help with creative writing, to promote
							literacy, to zen out, or just for creating silly stories.
						</p>
						<p>
							In building Q-Story, I tried to make the App simple, intuitive,
							and fun. I put emphasis in keeping this App casual, so that family
							and friends can pick it up during short breaks.
						</p>
						<p>I hope that you have a lot of fun using this App.</p>
